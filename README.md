# PixelArt
A repository to create sliding pixel arts from uploaded images which are displayed on 3.5inch display connected to an Orange Pi Zero running Armbian 5.91 Debian Buster. Due to hardware issues, works only with gray-scale and the "Out" folder contains inverted images. However the display shows the right gray-scaled image.

## ToDo:
 - Integration of a cloud service (such as Google Photos or Dropbox) and adding new images to the slideshow each time a change occurs in the server
 - New display
 - 3d printed case from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3580517
